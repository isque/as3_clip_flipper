h1. ClipFlipper

ClipFlipper is an AS3 project that allows MovieClips to be 'flipped over' horizontally, much like OS X's Dashboard widgets. Options include flipping speed, flipping style (circular and back-and-forth), and optional dropshadow.

Clips can also optionally be tweened on a per-corner basis, giving them a more flexible look, as though they're being bent as they flip over. (Experimental)
